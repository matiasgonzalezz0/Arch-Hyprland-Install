# Linux-Install-Helper
I use this scripts on every new Arch installation that I want to setup with Hyprland.
Feel free to use them and change them for your personal needs.

I use the yay AUR helper for the auto installation of AUR packages. You can install it with the [install_yay.sh](install_yay.sh) script.
